# Requirements Document - Woostify Banarasi Saree Banner

## Introduction

This feature focuses on customizing the homepage banner in a Woostify theme + Elementor setup to better align with the e-commerce business specializing in Banarasi Sarees and traditional Indian sarees. The current banner has generic content with "Learn More" and "Shop Now" buttons that need to be replaced with more meaningful, conversion-focused content that highlights the premium Banarasi Saree collection and encourages purchases.

**Technical Context**: The site uses Woostify theme with Elementor page builder. The banner is likely created using Elementor sections/widgets rather than theme-based sliders.
